Handwritten Digits Classification using Logistic Regression

This repository contains an implementation of a machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits using Logistic Regression. The model is trained and tested on the load_digits dataset provided by Scikit-learn, which includes images of digits (0-9) in an 8x8 pixel format.

Overview
The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The dataset used is the load_digits dataset from Scikit-learn, which contains 1,797 grayscale images of digits, each represented as an 8x8 pixel image. Each pixel is an integer in the range 0-16, representing different levels of intensity.
The model will be trained to classify the digits and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
Features
•	Classification of handwritten digits (0-9) using Logistic Regression.
•	Uses Scikit-learn's built-in load_digits dataset.
•	Includes model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
